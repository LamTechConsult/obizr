Good governance and dialogue may be impeded by the blight of corruption which disrupts free flow of information, undermines accountability and transparency for decisions and discourages greater participation in the decision making process.\r\n\r\nThus Open Government Initiative is designed to play a crucial role in the good governance of a democratic society by ensuring transparency and accountability, promoting participation and the rule of law through dialogue between the government and the citizens of this country. Since its inception in 2008, the Open Government Initiative is working with Civil Society Organizations and the media in facilitating dialogue between the citizens of this country and their Government. The Open Government Initiative partners with local Civil Society Organizations in the areas of sensitization and mobilization to enhance the impact of its activities to the Sierra Leone society."}},{"node":{"nid":"42206","title":"Two Stars Food Store","ratings":"0%","street":"6 Sillah Street","city":"Bo","email":"info@ntb.gov.sl","phone":"+232 76 643678","website":"http://www.ntb.gov.sl","chiefdom":"Kakua","category":"Hotel, Tourism and Travel","keywords":"Guest House","image":{"src":"http://slbr.sl/sites/default/files/styles/bis_mob_view/public/default_images/restaurant-banner.jpg?itok=bh0Y0njE","alt":""},"geocode_lat":"7.956822800000","geocode_long":"-11.752823000000","hours":"open - : 0:00-24:00","reviewcount":"0","description":"Fans, TV, Carpark, Tel,"}},{"node":{"nid":"41591","title":"Lungi Airport Hotel","ratings":"20%","street":"Tulun Road, Lungi P.O.

Prior to the establishment of the NRA, government revenue collection was fragmented and undertaken by the then Customs and Excise Department, Income Tax Department, Government Gold and Diamond Office and several other MDAs. One of the most outstanding reforms in the Sierra Leone Tax System was the bringing together of these revenue collecting agencies under the umbrella of the National Revenue Authority. The NRA has since played a vital role in formulating and implementing tax reforms that have resulted in increased revenue mobilization and trade facilitation.\r\n\r\nRevenue collection prior to the creation of NRA was low. In the very first year the NRA was established, revenue collection increased from Le231.8 billion in 2002 to Le277.8 billion in 2003. This trend has continued year-on-year as revenue collection grew considerably from a low base of Le 277.8 billion in 2003 to Le 2.219 Trillion in 2013"}},{"node":{"nid":"43704","title":"Standard Chartered Bank Cline Town Branch","ratings":"0%","street":"Chinese National Workshop","city":"Freetown","email":"customercase.sl@sc.com","phone":"(+232) 76 505609","website":"https://www.sc.com/sl/branches.html","chiefdom":"Freetown","category":"Financial Service","keywords":"Banks & Credit Unions","image":{"src":"http://slbr.sl/sites/default/files/styles/bis_mob_view/public/default_images/business-banner.jpg?itok=RCYpyVWR","alt":""},"geocode_lat":"8.489279748964","geocode_long":"-13.210327327251","hours":"closed -
